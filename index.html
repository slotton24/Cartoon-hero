				<h2>About Peter</h2>
				
				<p>Peter Griffin isn't quite a "family man", but I guess you could call him a "Family Guy".  He lives in the peaceful town of Quohog with his wife, Lois, his adoring kids, Chris and Stewie, and his loveable talking dog, Brian.  Oh and there's Meg.  Peter tries exceptionally hard at being a good father and husband, except when he doesn't.  He is wildly overweight and lazy, but that doesn't stop him from enjoying his work at the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery where he guzzles "free" beer on the clock.  His cutaway references are iconic and is able to cram random events, times, and notable people into almost any situation he's in, regardless of how irrelevant they are.  While he has several short-comings, his heart is usually in the right place and ends up making everything work out in the end...of the episode.</p>
